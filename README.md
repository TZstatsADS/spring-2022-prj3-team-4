+ Project summary: In this project, we carried out model evaluation and selection for predictive analytics on an imbalanced image data. We created two architectures, CNN and Transfer learning. For both CNN and Transfer Learning, model I was built on noisy dataset, and model 2 was built using label-correction dataset.
